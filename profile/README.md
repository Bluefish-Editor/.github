## About Bluefish
Bluefish is a robust, open-source code editor tailored for web developers and programmers who work on dynamic websites, scripts, and application code. It strikes a balance between the lightweight simplicity of basic text editors and the overwhelming complexity of full-fledged IDEs, offering a rich set of features focused on productivity without unnecessary bloat. Its clean, customizable interface provides multiple document editing, a sidebar file manager, and extensive toolbars for quick access to common functions like inserting code snippets, tags, or characters. Bluefish is particularly adept at handling the multi-language nature of web development, allowing seamless switching between HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side code within the same project.

What sets Bluefish apart are its powerful project management capabilities and its deep integration with web workflows. It includes a customizable snippets library, auto-completion for many tags and functions, and a unique "function reference" sidebar that provides quick documentation. The editor is highly optimized for large files and projects, with features like code folding, bookmarks, and a session recovery system. For web developers, the integrated publishing tools that support various protocols make deploying changes to a live server straightforward. Bluefish's extensibility through external filters and tools allows it to integrate into diverse development environments, making it a trusted, versatile tool for professional developers, system administrators, and advanced students.
